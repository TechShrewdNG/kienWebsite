        I have a technical background and graduated from HCMC UIT. But I also
        have a passion for colors, images, drawing so my first career is about
        designing, photoshop. I've designed websites since the 2000s, and I
        always keep upgrading my skills. For now, I'd love to resolve people's
        issues through software, app.
